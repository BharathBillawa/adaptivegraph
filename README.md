# Adaptive Graph
Learnable Conditional Edges for Agentic Workflows

It replaces hand-written branching logic with an experience-driven, self-improving conditional edge powered by contextual bandits.

This allows agent workflows to:
* adapt routing automatically
* reduce brittle heuristics
* self-correct routing mistakes
* optimize behavior based on real outcomes
